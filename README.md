# Yana Robot

(English | [Tiếng Việt](README_vi.md) | [한국어](README_ko.md))

## Overview

Yana Robot is MCP-based voice-assistant firmware for ESP32 hardware. It combines offline wake-word detection, streaming ASR/LLM/TTS pipelines, WebSocket and MQTT+UDP transports, and device-side + cloud-side MCP tool control, across a wide range of board variants.

## Origin

Yana Robot is built on top of the [XiaoZhi AI Chatbot](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) project, the original open-source ESP32 voice-assistant firmware created by Xiaoqiang ([78](https://github.com/78)) and Shenzhen Xinzhi Future Technology Co., Ltd. Full credit for the original codebase, protocol design, and hardware ecosystem goes to that project and its contributors.

This repository is an independent continuation: it is not affiliated with, and does not track, the upstream project. From this point forward, boards, fixes, and features here are designed and maintained separately as Yana Robot.

## Recent Updates

- The mainline now targets ESP-IDF v6.0 or later, with v6.0.2 as the preferred stable SDK. The previous 157-variant baseline was validated on ESP-IDF v6.0.1; the current matrix contains 171 variants, of which 170 support IDF 6.0.x and the ESP32-S31 variant requires IDF 6.1 or later.
- MQTT and BluFi cryptographic code has migrated to PSA Crypto. IDF 6 component splits and third-party dependency compatibility have also been addressed.
- Audio pipeline concurrency, MQTT/UDP packet validation, and release-matrix selection have been hardened.
- ESP-IDF v5.5 is retained only for documented legacy boards. ESP32-P4 Rev1 and Rev3 are both supported on IDF 6 with ESP-SR 2.4.7; see the [ESP-IDF 6.0 Migration Guide](docs/esp-idf-6-migration.md) for full compatibility and board-validation details.

### Features Implemented

- Wi-Fi, wired Ethernet, USB RNDIS, and ML307/EC801E or NT26 Cat.1 4G networking; supported boards can switch between Wi-Fi and 4G
- Offline voice wake-up with [ESP-SR](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr), including customizable wake words
- Two communication transports: [WebSocket](docs/websocket.md) and [MQTT + UDP](docs/mqtt-udp.md)
- Opus audio streaming with conventional streaming ASR + LLM + TTS pipelines and Realtime end-to-end voice models; AEC-capable hardware supports realtime full-duplex interaction
- Speaker recognition, identifies the current speaker [3D Speaker](https://github.com/modelscope/3D-Speaker)
- OLED / LCD displays with emoji and rich expression support, plus camera vision input on supported boards
- Battery display and power management
- 39 interface languages, with localized voice prompts where available and English fallback
- ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C6, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-P4 chip platforms
- Wi-Fi provisioning through hotspot or BluFi
- Device-side MCP for device control (Speaker, LED, Servo, GPIO, etc.)
- Cloud-side MCP to extend large model capabilities (smart home control, PC desktop operation, knowledge search, email, etc.)
- Customizable wake words, fonts, emojis, and chat backgrounds with online web-based editing ([Custom Assets Generator](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-assets-generator))

## Software

### Firmware Flashing

For beginners, it is recommended to use the firmware that can be flashed without setting up a development environment.

The firmware connects to the official [xiaozhi.me](https://xiaozhi.me) server by default. Personal users can register an account to use the Qwen real-time model for free.

### Development Environment

- Cursor or VSCode
- Install the ESP-IDF plugin. [ESP-IDF v6.0.2](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v6.0.2) is preferred; use a stable v6.0 or later release. ESP-IDF v5.5.2 is retained only for legacy board compatibility
- Linux is better than Windows for faster compilation and fewer driver issues
- This project uses Google C++ code style, please ensure compliance when submitting code

### Developer Documentation

- [ESP-IDF 6.0 Migration Guide](docs/esp-idf-6-migration.md) - SDK compatibility, component changes, legacy hardware support, and board validation status
- [Custom Board Guide](docs/custom-board.md) - Learn how to create custom boards
- [MCP Protocol IoT Control Usage](docs/mcp-usage.md) - Learn how to control IoT devices via MCP protocol
- [MCP Protocol Interaction Flow](docs/mcp-protocol.md) - Device-side MCP protocol implementation
- [MQTT + UDP Hybrid Communication Protocol Document](docs/mqtt-udp.md)
- [A detailed WebSocket communication protocol document](docs/websocket.md)

## Large Model Configuration

If you already have a device connected to the official server, you can log in to the [xiaozhi.me](https://xiaozhi.me) console for configuration.
